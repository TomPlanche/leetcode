/// # `colored_cells`
/// Calculates the total number of colored cells after n minutes in a grid where cells
/// adjacent to colored cells get colored each minute.
///
/// # Algorithm
/// Uses the mathematical formula 2nÂ² - 2n + 1 which was derived from the pattern of
/// cell growth where:
/// - First minute: 1 cell
/// - Each subsequent minute: Adds cells touching any colored cell
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `n` - Number of minutes, where 1 <= n <= 10^5
///
/// # Returns
/// * `i64` - Total number of colored cells after n minutes
