# Intuition
The problem asks us to find the two closest prime numbers within a given range [left, right]. My first thought was to generate all prime numbers in this range and then find the pair with the minimum difference. If there are multiple pairs with the same minimum difference, we need to return the one with the smallest first number.

# Approach
1. **Generate prime numbers**: We use the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a classic algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. This is an efficient way to generate all primes in our range.

2. **Edge case handling**: If there are fewer than 2 prime numbers in the range, we return [-1, -1] as specified in the problem.

3. **Find closest pair**: We iterate through the list of primes (which are already in ascending order), calculating the difference between consecutive primes. We keep track of the pair with the minimum difference. Since we're processing the primes in ascending order, if we find multiple pairs with the same difference, we'll naturally keep the one with the smallest first number.

4. **Return result**: We return the pair of primes with the minimum difference.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log log n), where n is the upper bound (right). This is due to the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm used to generate the primes. The subsequent iteration through the primes to find the closest pair is O(p), where p is the number of primes in the range, but this is dominated by the sieve's complexity.

- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the upper bound (right). We need to store a boolean array of size right+1 for the sieve, plus an array to store the generated primes (which is generally smaller than the sieve array).
